## First Look at Using Markdown

Markdown is a type of language that is used to format text.

The default GitHub read me file (README.md) is intended for markdown use.



# Headers

You can create headers in Markdown by prefixing "#" (hashtag/pound/number sign) to the intended header content.

Ex.
# This is a HEADER

Just like with HTML, there are 6 header sizes.

# H1 Header
Written as "# H1 Header"
```shell
# H1 Header
```
## H2 Header
Written as "## H2 Header"
```shell
## H2 Header
```
### H3 Header
Written as "### H3 Header"
```shell
### H3 Header
```
#### H4 Header
Written as "#### H4 Header"
```shell
#### H4 Header
```
##### H5 Header
Written as "##### H5 Header"
```shell
##### H5 Header
```
###### H6 Header
Written as "###### H6 Header"
```shell
###### H6 Header
```


# Links

Another good feature for enhancing our Markdown is using links.

To create a link follow this syntax: 
```shell
[Link Text](URL)
```
EX.
```shell
The infamous [Click Here](http://www.jacquesbegin.com) link.
```
The infamous [Click Here](http://www.jacquesbegin.com) link.
