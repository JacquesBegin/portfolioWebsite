Markdown is a type of language that is used to format text.

The default GitHub read me file (README.md) is intended for markdown use.



Headers

You can create headers in Markdown by prefixing "#" (hashtag/pound/number sign) to the intended header content.

Ex.
# This is a HEADER

Just like with HTML, there are 6 header sizes.

# H1 Header
Written as "# H1 Header"
## H2 Header
Written as "# H2 Header"
### H3 Header
Written as "# H3 Header"
#### H4 Header
Written as "# H4 Header"
##### H5 Header

###### H6 Header
