      <div class="homeContentMessage">
          I was born and raised in Western New York (and not the west side of the city, I mean the west side of the state, also known as farm country). It was here that I learned how to develop strong, quality relationships within smaller communities. I worked a variety of jobs; tree farming, grocery store clerk and butcher, title search abstractor, and more! Eventually I moved to Florida and took on management roles within the retail world's of Sony Electronics and Target Corporation. Here I gained an appreciation for the importance of how a team can work together to take on big challenges to create positive outcomes no matter the circumstances. While I found success in these endeavours, they lacked the opportunities to be truly creative while bringing new ideas to life. This led me to pursue a new goal.....the development world of programming. I went back to school and got my degree in Computer & Web Programming. Then I upgraded my skills by completing a Web Development Bootcamp in Toronto, Canada.
