          I was born and raised in Western New York (and not the west side of the city, I mean the west side of the state, also known as farm country). It was here that I learned how to develop strong, quality relationships within smaller communities. I worked a variety of jobs; tree farming, grocery store clerk and butcher, title search abstractor, and more! Eventually I moved to Florida and took on management roles within the retail world's of Sony Electronics and Target Corporation. Here I gained an appreciation for the importance of how a team can work together to take on big challenges to create positive outcomes no matter the circumstances. While I found success in these endeavours, they lacked the opportunities to be truly creative while bringing new ideas to life. This led me to pursue a new goal.....the development world of programming. I went back to school and got my degree in Computer & Web Programming. Then I upgraded my skills by completing a Web Development Bootcamp in Toronto, Canada.

          I recently completed an internship with IBM Canada and it was a great experience! I worked with some very talented and experienced people within all phases of the software development life cycle (design, development, testing, and more). The major project I was assigned to had me take a client's existing production level internal web application and integrate new search functionalities. Using the technologies of JavaScript, JQWidgets, Java, and SQL (Oracle), I was able to fulfill the project needs in a "faster than expected" timeframe. By successfully incorporating the new features, I was able to provide a way for the client to more easily and efficiently help their customer. Therefore the client could move on to other business needs and the customer could get back to what's important in their lives. I attend numerous tech events around Toronto from React and React Native training's, hackathons, and tech conferences. I feel it's important to foster a community that supports each other, so I volunteer as a mentor for JavaScript frontend and database essentials courses. Being able to give back, the way others have done for me is a truly rewarding experience.

          Tomorrow's successes are dictated by today's goals. If we don't know where we want to go, how will we ever get there? That's why everyday I write out plans for what I will work on to become a better developer, a better student of life, and a better person. I see myself making a difference in other's lives through the applications I work on. Teaching and mentoring will become bigger components in my day to day activities. Soon my soulmate and I will meet and start a beautiful family if we are so blessed. Finding balance between work and play, obligation and opportunity will be key for everyday happiness. This will be a great journey, with many up's and some down's but always filled with love and positivity. We all make it to the finish line in this life on Earth, but it's the journey that brings true joy. Now let's get out there and never look back!
