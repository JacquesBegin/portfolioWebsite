        While searching the endless newsfeed about all things tech related, I came across a tutorial about creating a command line application (Credit goes to David Neal https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/06/18/command-line-app-with-nodejs). This sparked my interest about learning the command line a bit better.
        
        I have seen great features in the command line such as; text editing, programming language interpreters, and version control. But how does it work? How does the system know what to do when a certain command is entered?
        
        A quick answer is; inputting a command tells the system to run particular scripts or programs that perform tasks. Sometimes the task returns data, other times it performs actions behind the scene. There’s really nothing related to an operating system that can’t be done in the command line.
        
        I decided to go ahead with the tutorial. I hope to get a new perspective about the command line and learn some of the behind the scenes features it offers.

        Today I continued to work on the command line application using Node.js. I implemented support for command line arguments by using the yargs package. Since I first started learning to use the command line, I have wondered how the system knows what to do when an argument in passed. 
        
        Passing arguments with commands is an interesting concept. It seems so simple to control a program with a few extra words or flags. But what really goes on behind the scenes?
        
        Well, to fully answer this question would go well beyond the scope of this article.
        
        But a brief insight is this…
        
        Each command line application or script could accept any number of arguments depending on the needs or features of that program. Adding arguments could provide information about a program, begin a series of tests on code the user has written, or call additional scripts. There are so many possibilities it would be difficult to list them all here (and frankly, I do not know them all myself…and that’s one reason why I decided to build a command line application in the first place!)
        
        I look forward to continuing this project and learning more ways for how the command line can improve my technical prowess!
