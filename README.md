# portfolioWebsite
My personal static portfolio website.

[Portfolio Site on GitHubs Pages:](https://jacquesbegin.github.io/portfolioWebsite/index.html)

The principle design concept for this site is to showcase my abilities working with the frontend technologies and methodologies of HTML/CSS/Sass/Responsive Design/BEM. It is a single page design style where all content will display on the index.html page and links will navigate to bookmarks (within the same page) for related information. I chose to work with these core technologies to show that a simple, elegant website does not need an over abundance of technologies behind it.
