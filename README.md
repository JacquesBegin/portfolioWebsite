# portfolioWebsite
My personal static portfolio website.

The principle design concept for this site is to showcase my abilities working with the frontend technologies of HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery. It is a single page design style where all content will; display on the index.html page and will be updated/injected using JavaScript/jQuery. I chose to work with only these core technologies to get a deeper understanding for how they work. This will help me to understand the underlying principles that many popular frontend frameworks (React, Angular, etc.) use to make the life of a frontend web developer more efficient and easier.
